# PAC
This is the PAC PMO website GIT repository. The directory structure is very simply
1. Home
2. Resources
  * Images (for all images in/on the site)
  * Documents (for all non-HTML documents, e.g. PPT, .PDF, etc.)

NOTE: I HIGHLY suggest NOT using documents that are nont PDFs on the site. All files should be converted to PDF.
